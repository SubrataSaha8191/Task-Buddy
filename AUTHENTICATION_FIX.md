# üîê Authentication & Multi-Account Fix

## Problem Identified
When logging in with different Google accounts, users were seeing the same profile data because all user data was stored with generic localStorage keys that didn't differentiate between users.

## Root Cause
- **Old Approach**: Used generic keys like `"taskbuddy-profile"`, `"taskbuddy-tasks"`, etc.
- **Issue**: All users shared the same localStorage slots
- **Result**: Switching accounts showed cached data from previous user

## Solution Implemented

### ‚úÖ User-Specific Storage System

Changed from generic storage keys to **user-specific keys** using Firebase UID:

**Before:**
```javascript
localStorage.getItem("taskbuddy-profile")
localStorage.getItem("taskbuddy-tasks")
localStorage.getItem("goals")
localStorage.getItem("taskbuddy-settings")
```

**After:**
```javascript
localStorage.getItem(`taskbuddy-profile-${user.uid}`)
localStorage.getItem(`taskbuddy-tasks-${user.uid}`)
localStorage.getItem(`taskbuddy-goals-${user.uid}`)
localStorage.getItem(`taskbuddy-settings-${user.uid}`)
```

## Files Modified

### 1. **UserProfileContext.jsx** ‚ú®
- Added Firebase auth listener with `onAuthStateChanged`
- Loads profile data using user-specific key: `taskbuddy-profile-${user.uid}`
- Automatically initializes fresh profile for new users
- Syncs Google profile photo, name, and email
- Clears profile data when user logs out

### 2. **TaskContext.jsx** üìã
- Added Firebase auth state listener
- Loads tasks using user-specific key: `taskbuddy-tasks-${user.uid}`
- Each user maintains separate task lists
- Tasks persist correctly when switching accounts

### 3. **GoalContext.jsx** üéØ
- Added Firebase auth state listener
- Loads goals using user-specific key: `taskbuddy-goals-${user.uid}`
- Each user has independent goals
- Added `LOAD_GOALS` action to reducer

### 4. **SettingsContext.jsx** ‚öôÔ∏è
- Added Firebase auth state listener
- Loads settings using user-specific key: `taskbuddy-settings-${user.uid}`
- Theme preferences are per-user
- Notification settings persist per account

### 5. **AuthPage.jsx** üîë
- Updated `handleGoogleLogin` to use user-specific storage
- Updated `handleEmailAuth` to use user-specific storage
- Proper profile initialization for new accounts
- Checks for existing profile using UID-based key

### 6. **SidebarMenu.jsx** üì§
- Removed generic profile data clearing on logout
- Data now persists correctly per user
- Logout only signs out, doesn't delete profile data

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:
1. User authenticates with Google/Email
2. Firebase returns user object with unique `uid`
3. App loads data using keys like `taskbuddy-profile-${uid}`
4. If no data exists, initializes fresh profile
5. All changes save to user-specific keys

### Account Switching:
1. User logs out (data stays in localStorage)
2. User logs in with different account
3. New `uid` triggers loading different storage keys
4. Each account sees only their own data

### Data Isolation:
```
User A (uid: abc123):
  - taskbuddy-profile-abc123
  - taskbuddy-tasks-abc123
  - taskbuddy-goals-abc123
  - taskbuddy-settings-abc123

User B (uid: xyz789):
  - taskbuddy-profile-xyz789
  - taskbuddy-tasks-xyz789
  - taskbuddy-goals-xyz789
  - taskbuddy-settings-xyz789
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Complete Data Isolation** - Each user has separate storage
‚úÖ **Proper Account Switching** - No more cached data issues
‚úÖ **Profile Persistence** - Data survives logout/login cycles
‚úÖ **Google Profile Sync** - Auto-imports name, email, photo
‚úÖ **Fresh Start for New Users** - Clean slate for first-time accounts
‚úÖ **Backwards Compatible** - Works with existing Firebase auth

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Login with Google Account A
- [x] Add tasks, goals, update profile
- [x] Logout
- [x] Login with Google Account B
- [x] Verify clean profile (no Account A data)
- [x] Add different tasks/goals
- [x] Switch back to Account A
- [x] Verify Account A data is still there
- [x] Test theme preferences per account
- [x] Test email signup and login

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended (Optional):
1. **Cloud Sync** - Use Firebase Firestore instead of localStorage
2. **Data Migration** - Migrate old generic keys to user-specific keys
3. **Multi-Device Sync** - Real-time sync across devices
4. **Data Export** - Allow users to download their data
5. **Account Deletion** - Clean up localStorage on account deletion

## Migration Note

Users who logged in before this fix may have data in old generic keys. Consider adding a one-time migration script to move data from old keys to new user-specific keys.
